# buscard

This sample Flutter app demonstrates a simple business card scanner.
Users can capture photos of a card, select its orientation (horizontal or vertical),
and store basic information in a local SQLite database along with the image path.

## Features
- Capture an image using the device camera.
- Store name, company, phone, email, orientation, and photo path in SQLite.
- View saved cards in a list.

This code serves as a minimal starting point and is not production ready.
